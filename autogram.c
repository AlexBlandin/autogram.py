  So, the only way to go faster is to stop using strings entirely.
  Every single "wordification" has a known contribution of occurences, so we're just doing vector additions.
  Given a candidate string x, we have occurences for each character [a..z], which gives `counts: [26]int`
  This can be used such that from this, we can just row-wise sum `map(sum, [as_word[c] for c in counts].T)`
  In python, we might use numpy, which has efficient SIMD usage for this.
  In C, we can just do it directly, and even if we aren't being optimal, we're losing less in overheads.
  If I keep everything to 0..255 occurences, that means we use bytes, so hashing is quick and uses a hash set
  or if sacrificing collisions can use a bloom filter and save on memory (which may be nice and fast too!)
